The project uses the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch a list of movies, and includes features like
recommendations and watchlisting your favourite movies.

### Running the project

Before running, see instructions on how to [get a TMDB API key](#getting-a-tmdb-api-key).

Also, make sure to run on **Flutter beta** channel.

## App Overview

The application is composed by three primary screens: **Home**, **Watchlist** and **Profiles**.

On first launch, the app asks the user to create a profile. 

On the **Home** page you'll find a curated selection of upcoming and currently playing movies, along with a dynamic carousel slider showcasing featured titles.

Each movie shows as a poster using the image URL retrieved from the API. Tap on any movie to view its detailed description, where you can play it directly by clicking the play icon. You can also add the movie to your watchlist using the add icon.

Open the **Watchlist** page to see the list of favourites for the currently selected profile.

Use the **Profiles** page to choose from a variety of customized avatars to create or update your profile.
